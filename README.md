Predictive modeling techniques used in Thika to forecast air quality levels and pollutant concentrations in 2024

## Thika Town Background

Thika, a bustling industrial town located in Kiambu County, Kenya, approximately 40 kilometers northeast of Nairobi, the capital city of Kenya. It is home to around 139,000 people, according to the 2019 census and is known for its manufacturing industries, particularly in the textile, steel, and food processing sectors.

In relation to air quality, Thika town is of particular interest due to its industrial activities, which can contribute to air pollution. The town is surrounded by several industrial estates, including the Thika Industrial Area, which is home to numerous factories and manufacturing plants.

Additionally, Thika town is located near several major highways, including the Thika Superhighway, which connects Nairobi to the eastern parts of the country. The high volume of traffic on these highways can lead to increased emissions of pollutants from vehicles.

The air quality in Thika town is, therefore, a concern, and monitoring the levels of pollutants such as AQI, CO, NO, NO2, O3, SO2, PM2.5, PM10, and NH3 is essential to understand the extent of air pollution and its impact on the health of the residents and the environment.
